# Get Swell

## What is the problem you’re solving?

The fitness industry is fraught with body shaming and toxic weightloss "inspiration." People often stop pursuing their goals because they buckle under unrealistic expectations about how they look. And even if they do achieve those goals, they often fail to enjoy the journey and build sustainable habits along the way. And sometimes it's challenging to find a supportive and non-judgemental community to help them stay on track.

## What is the solution?

Get Swell -- a social media app where users can connect, encourage each other to move, and achieve their goals mindfully without pushing toxic beliefs. It's less about getting swole and more about feeling swell.

## What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)

1. Basic CRUD functionality
2. Users can set and update preferences
3. Populate post feed based on preferences

## What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?

2. Image storage and handling
3. Post creation and image uploading from the front-end

4. Login page and redirect
5. Personal profile page

### Back-End:
1. Authentication
2. Testing
3. Production build, web hosing, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
